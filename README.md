# Stock-Trend-Prediction-Using-News-Sentiment-Analysis
This GitHub repository contains a Python project designed to automate the monitoring of financial markets and efficiently gather trading ideas. The project utilizes web scraping techniques, NLP-based summarization, and sentiment analysis to extract valuable insights from finance news articles and calculate sentiment for specific assets.

# ABSTRACT

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a widely recognized theory in finance that suggests 
that all available information about a stock is already reflected in its current market price. 
According to EMH, it is impossible for an investor to consistently outperform the market because 
stock prices already reflect all known information.
Despite the popularity of the EMH, there have been several instances where it has been 
challenged and even shown to be flawed. This has led to a surge in research efforts aimed at 
finding alternative methods for predicting stock trends. One such method involves using non-quantifiable data, such as financial news articles, to predict future stock trends.
The idea behind this approach is that news articles can have a significant impact on stock market 
performance. By analysing news sentiment and classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral, it 
is possible to gain insights into how a particular company is perceived by the public and how this 
perception might affect its stock performance.
This project aims to explore the relationship between news sentiment and stock trends by 
analysing financial news articles about a particular company and using this data to predict its 
future stock trend. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, 
the project seeks to identify patterns in the news sentiment data that can be used to make accurate 
predictions about future stock trends.
The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide investors with a new tool for 
predicting stock trends. By incorporating news sentiment analysis into their decision-making 
processes, investors may be able to make more informed decisions and achieve better returns. 
Additionally, the project may shed light on the extent to which news sentiment influences stock 
market performance and contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship 
between news and finance.
